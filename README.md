SCSS Dropdown, I dont need bootstrap dropdowns while I can make own 
> NO JS 

[Demo](https://codepen.io/hkkcngz/full/PoGXYvG)

### Edit:
Check! v1.1 => [Demo v.1.1] (https://codepen.io/hkkcngz/full/RwGEPdP)
- Fixed closing dropdown when open other dropdown. 

### Usage
- All you need changing label for and  input ID.
- If you want to use right aligned add "dropdown-right" class.


## Why you coded this?
- Because I am too lazy to handle/struggle with bootstrap react libray. This also React hack :P
